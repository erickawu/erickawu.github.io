	  <p>It’s probably a question you never had. Regardless, I’ve answered it.</p>
	  <p> As stated on their website, the archives at the Metropolitan Museum hold over 470,000 works, and the data and pictures of these objects can be accessed via the Met's publicly released API <a href = 'https://metmuseum.github.io/'>here</a>. Each work has around 50 attributes (date added to collection, medium, and even under what fund a piece is purchased). 
	  <p> Having spent a significant portion of our classtime on European works, especially portraiture, in Art Humanities @ Columbia, I chose the most fitting subset of data: European Portraits, department 8 out of 13.</p>
	  <p>This small visualization aims to give one a bit of insight into the the aesthetic representation of the human face European portraits. It provides a visual overview of its style and development throughout the years, and .</p>

	  <div class=sectiontitle>Methodology</div>
	  <p>Using OpenCV in Python, I constructed a series of scripts that normalized faces from each portrait input by performing facial detection, assigning facial landmarks, aligning features, and warping the image based on Delaunay triangulation. This way, an accurate and nonpolluted average can be taken across the subset of transformed faces. In other words, it’s a fancy way of saying: I cropped the portraits into uncomfortably close face shots, squashed those into 2D, and took the average of those faces.</p>
	  <p> Out of the 2278 works housed in the department, only 797 of them had one or more faces detected. Keep in mind, then, that this isn’t the most accurate representation of the Met’s collection of European portraits (more on that later — fig. in progress). This is discounting their trove of nondocumented works, too. </p>

	  <p> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. s well as a look into the Met’s curation of pieces that it believes to represent of these periods. </p>
